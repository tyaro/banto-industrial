//! relay-wright's domain/service layer (spec §10). Kept tauri-free so it
//! is testable without the src-tauri crate (which cannot be built in every
//! environment, e.g. CI containers without webkit2gtk). Thin
//! `tauri::command` adapters in `src-tauri` call into this crate; the same
//! services back the embedded REST server in M6.
